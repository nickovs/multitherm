# MultiTherm

MultiTherm is a multi-channel, controllable thermostat system based on
the [MicroPython](https://micropython.org)
[pyBoard](https://store.micropython.org/#/features). It supports up to
eight channels; each channel uses a remote thermistor (I've been using
the flush-mount [Aprilaire 8051]
(https://www.alpinehomeair.com/viewproduct.cfm?productid=453059031)
for mine) to sense the temperature in a room and a relay to control an
existing heating circuit.
