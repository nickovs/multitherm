# MultiTherm

MultiTherm is a multi-channel, controllable thermostat system based on
the [MicroPython](https://micropython.org)
[pyBoard](https://store.micropython.org/#/features).

This code is designed to It support up to eight channels; each channel
uses a thermistor and a fixed resistor on an analogue input to measure
the temperature and a relay connected to a digital output to control an
existing heating circuit. Details of a suitable hardware configuration
can be found in the the [hardware](hardware/Hardware.md) subdirectory.
